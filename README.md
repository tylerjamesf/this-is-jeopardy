# This is Jeopardy! - ðŸŒŸ portfolio project

## Overview

A slightly different project than worked on before; this porject conmtains a series of open-ended questions which describe the portfolio project that I will be building. This is part of my course for Codecademy Pandas and Python for Data Analysis.

## Project Goals

Work to write several functions that investigate a dataset of Jeopardy! questions and answers. Filter the dataset for topics that you're interested in, compute the average difficulty of those questions, and train to become the next Jeopardy champion!

### Requirements

a provided offline dataset in csv format containing data about the game show _Jeopardy!_ in file named `jeopardy.csv`
